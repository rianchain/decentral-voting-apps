# VoteChain3 Pemilu

VoteChain3 is a decentralized voting application built on the Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain Optimism. The app allows users to vote for candidates in a secure and transparent manner. By using blockchain technology, VoteChain3 ensures that every vote is transparently recorded and cannot be manipulated, thus increasing trust in the voting process.


## Features

- Decentralized Voting: Users can vote without intermediaries, ensuring transparency and security.

- Candidate Registration: Only the contract owner can add new candidates for the election.

- Multiple Vote Prevention: Each address can only vote once to prevent cheating.

- Vote Report: Users can view voting results in real-time.

- User Friendly Interface: Responsive and easy-to-use interface for all users.

## Advantages

- Decentralization: No third party controls your data.

- Security: Your data is stored on the blockchain, which offers a high level of security.

- User-Friendly: Simple and easy-to-use interface.

- Low Transaction Fees: Uses the Optimism Sepolia network 
which offers lower transaction fees compared to the main Ethereum network.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


### Deployment


### `npm run build`
